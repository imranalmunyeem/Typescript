# Typescript
#### What is Typescript?
    --- Superset of JavaScript that adds features and functionality to the language.
    --- Developed by Microsoft, open-source, and can run on any platform that supports JavaScript.
    --- TypeScript code is compiled to JavaScript, so it can run on any platform that supports JavaScript.
    
#### What are the benefits of using TypeScript?
    ---TypeScript enforces strong typing, which means that variables and functions must be assigned specific types. This helps catch errors before runtime, improving code quality and reducing bugs.

    ---TypeScript supports classes, modules, and interfaces, making it easier to organize code into logical structures.

    ---TypeScript has excellent tooling support, including code completion, error detection, and refactoring, which can help improve developer productivity.

    ---ETypeScript is especially useful for large-scale applications, where it can help ensure that code remains organized and maintainable over time.

    ---TypeScript is designed to be compatible with existing JavaScript code, so developers can easily integrate TypeScript into their existing projects.

    ---TypeScript has a large and active community, with many libraries, frameworks, and tools available to support development.

#### Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript?
    ---TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that it requires variables and functions to have predefined types at compile-time. In contrast, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that types are determined at runtime.

    ---TypeScript provides the option to declare types, but it also allows for type inference, meaning that the type can be inferred by the context. JavaScript, on the other hand, does not provide type declarations or type inference.

    ---TypeScript has built-in support for object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, interfaces, and inheritance. Although JavaScript can support object-oriented programming, it does not have built-in support for these concepts.

    ---TypeScript has better tooling and IDE support than JavaScript, which can help improve developer productivity by providing features such as code completion, error detection, and refactoring.

    ---TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that existing JavaScript code can be used in TypeScript without modification. However, TypeScript code cannot be used directly in JavaScript.
